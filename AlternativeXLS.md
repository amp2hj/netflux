# Introduction #

The input to Netflux is a user generated Excel (XLS) file that defines the species and reactions in their network. What if the user does not have access to Microsoft Excel? There are free alternatives to Excel, such as OpenOffice, that are compatible with Netflux as long as the following settings are followed:

  * Make sure the spreadsheet adheres to the rules for [formatting an XLS file](XLS.md).
  * For OpenOffice Users: Save as any of the .xls file types (Microsoft Excel 95 or Microsoft Excel 5.0 are preferred, or Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP)
  * For Google Doc Users: After exporting as an Excel file, open up the Worksheet, and save it as a .xls file using another spreadsheet program, such as OpenOffice.
    * Reason: Exporting from Google seems to save the data into Unicode, which Netflux does not support.  Saving the file again using another spreadsheet program will remedy this error.
