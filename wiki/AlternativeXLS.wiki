#summary This page guides users on how to create an XLS Network file without Microsoft Excel.

= Introduction =

The input to Netflux is a user generated Excel (XLS) file that defines species and reactions in their network. What if the user does not have access to Microsoft Excel? There are free alternatives to Excel, such as !OpenOffice, that are compatible with Netflux as long as the following settings are followed.

  * Make sure the spreadsheet adheres to the rules for formatting an XLS file
or Google Doc Users: After exporting as an Excel file, open up the Worksheet, and save it as a .xls file using another spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel or !OpenOffice. 
   * Reason: Exporting from Google seems to save the data into Unicode, which Netflux does not support.  Saving the file again using another spreadsheet program will remedy this error. 
  * For !OpenOffice Users: Save as any of the .xls file types (Microsoft Excel 95 or Microsoft Excel 5.0 are preferred, or Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP)
