= Introduction =

Visual representation helps immensely in portraying data. Netflux may be used in conjunction with Cytoscape to create a picture of your network. 

= Requirements = 
  * Cytoscape, which can be found at http://cytoscape.org/

= How To Create A Visual Representation of Your Network Using Cytoscape=

  # Locate the Cytoscape network (.sif) and nodeAttribute (.txt) files. These files should have been automatically generated after running Netflux.m (look for the status display) and stored in your current directory.  
  # Also create a data sheet (.txt) by uncommenting the two lines located around Line 27 in NetfluxSourceCode.m and running it. Text should pop up in the MATLAB command line if the data sheet has been created successfully.   
  # Open Cytoscape.  In order to animate the simulation, you’ll need to download the Dynamic Expression plug-in.  
  # Download Dynamic Expression at the Cytoscape website. To do this, click on the following link http://chianti.ucsd.edu/cyto_web/plugins/index.php. 
   * On the Cytoscape 2.x Plugins page, select “Analysis” tab to expand it, then select the dynamicXpr plug-in to download it. Below is a picture of the dynamicXpr plug-in.

5. After dynamicXpr is downloaded, go to the folder containing the file. Move dynamicXpr to the “plugins” folder in the Cytoscape directory. 
  * When Dynamic Expression is downloaded correctly, you will see the Dynamic Expression command under “Plugins” (Picture below).http://people.virginia.edu/~std6n/netflux/NetfluxWikiPics/Figure_5.jpg
Now you will need to import 3 files: a network (.sif), a node attribute (.txt) and a viz map properties (.props) file.

6. To import the network go to

	 		File --> Import --> Network (Multiple File Types)...

Browse to the .sif file that you should have located in Step 1. The file location is where you extracted the contents of !NetfluxSource.zip.  There should now be a network in Cytoscape’s network area (figure below).

7. To import the node attribute go to 

			File --> Import --> Node Attributes…

Browse to the `[NetworkName]_nodeAttributes.txt` file that you should have located in Step 1. It should be located where you extracted !NetfluxSource.zip and named `[networkname]_nodeAttributes.txt`. To display the node attributes, select the ‘Node Attribute Browser’ in the Data Panel, and then select the icon above the ID column.  Check which attributes you would like to see in the Data Panel (Figure 7).
