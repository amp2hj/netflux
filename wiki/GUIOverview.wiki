#summary This page describes the function of the Netflux GUI

= Introduction =

Netflux provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for users to manipulate their network. 

= Access = 

Users can access the GUI in 2 ways:
  # Without MATLAB, run Netflux.exe ([GettingStarted#MATLAB_Independent follow the instructions for 'MATLAB Independent'])
  # Using MATLAB, run Netflux.m ([GettingStarted#MATLAB_Dependent follow the instructions for 'MATLAB Dependent'])

  # _*Load New Model_* – Push the button to load a new Excel file. Doing so will reset all parameters and graphs. 
  # _*Simulation Time_* – Input the time (in seconds) that you want to simulate your reaction. The time starts from the previous simulation time. For example, if you Simulated the reaction for 10 seconds previously, and Simulated again for 10 seconds, the Graph and Data will show for 20 seconds. “Reset Simulation” in order to start from time zero. 
  # _*Species to Plot_* – The species highlighted will be the species plotted in the graph. Control+click in order to plot multiple species at once. The plotting occurs after you push “Simulate!”
  # _*Simulate!_* – Causes the simulation to occur 
  # _*Plot_* – Replot the graph without running through another time step. For example, you forgot to plot Species B with Species A and you do not want to go through another time step. 
  # _*Reset Parameters_* – Resets all species and reaction parameters.
  # _*Reset Simulation_* – Resets the starting time to zero and clears the graph. Does *NOT* reset the parameters. 
  # _*Copy Plot_* – A separate figure box will pop up showing just the graph. To copy the graph, go to Edit --> Copy Figure. Alternatively, you can save the graph by going to File --> Save As… 
   * NOTE: Legend does not currently copy due to constraints of the GUI used. 
  # _*Export Data_* – Exports the data for each species at one-second intervals into a text file for use in programs such as Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/). 
   * Note a: the data are space delimited.    
  # _*Export Cytoscape Network_* – Exports the data for each species into _yournetworkmodel.sif_ and _yournetworkmodel_nodeAttributes.txt_ for use in Cytoscape.
  # _*Export ODE List_* - Exports the ODE list  
  # _*Species List_*  - A drop down menu for you to select which species to alter
  # _*Tau_* – A slider bar for you to alter the reaction time constant parameter of your selected species
  # _*Yinit_* – A slider bar for you to alter the initial y parameter of your selected species
  # _*Ymax_* – A slider bar for you to alter the ‘ymax’ parameter of your selected species
  # _*Reaction List_* – A drop down menu for you to select which reaction to alter
  # _*Weight_* – A slider bar for you to alter the reaction weight parameter of your selected reaction
  # _*n_* – A slider bar for you to alter the hill coefficient parameter of your selected reaction
  # _*k_* – A slider bar for you to alter the half-maximal effective concentration parameter of your selected reaction 
  # _*Status Text_* – Displays various messages depending on your actions
